# One By Two

**Split expenses. Not friendships.**

**One By Two** (1/2) — the name means splitting in half. In everyday Indian English, *"one by two"* is how you share something equally — *"ek chai one by two"*. The name captures the app's core purpose: **splitting expenses**, simply and fairly.

One By Two is a clean, simple, and **ad-free** expense sharing app built with **Flutter** and **Google Firebase**. Designed for the **Indian audience**, it works seamlessly online and offline, making it easy to split bills with friends, roommates, travel groups, and couples — all in ₹.
