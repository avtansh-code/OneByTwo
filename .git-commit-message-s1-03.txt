feat(architecture): Complete Clean Architecture scaffolding (S1-03)

Implemented complete three-layer Clean Architecture for OneByTwo app.

## Architecture Structure
- Created 33 directories following Clean Architecture pattern
- Domain layer: entities, repositories, usecases, value_objects
- Data layer: local/dao, remote/firestore, models, mappers, repositories, sync
- Presentation layer: providers, features (auth, home, groups, expenses, settlements, profile)
- Core infrastructure: config, constants, error, router, theme, utils, widgets

## Core Infrastructure
- Result<T> sealed class for error handling
- Comprehensive AppException hierarchy (7 exception types)
- AppConfig with environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- AppConstants with app-wide constants
- GoRouter configuration with placeholder home screen

## Dependencies Added (32 packages)
- State Management: Riverpod v2+ with code generation
- Navigation: GoRouter v14
- Local Database: sqflite
- Firebase: Core, Auth, Firestore, Analytics, Crashlytics, Remote Config
- Secure Storage: flutter_secure_storage
- Code Generation: freezed, json_serializable, riverpod_generator
- Utilities: uuid, intl, connectivity_plus, shared_preferences, logger
- UI: cached_network_image
- Testing: mocktail

## Code Quality
- Updated analysis_options.yaml with 150+ strict lint rules
- All code follows immutability patterns with @immutable annotation
- Zero analysis warnings (flutter analyze passes)
- All tests passing (flutter test passes)

## Documentation
- Created architecture README with quick reference
- Created comprehensive Quick Start Guide for developers
- Task completion report with known issues and resolutions

## Known Issues
- Build runner has analyzer version incompatibility (workaround applied)
- Custom lint temporarily disabled due to analyzer compatibility

## Verification
✓ flutter pub get - Success
✓ flutter analyze - No issues found
✓ flutter test - All tests passed
